<h1>The Best Movies According to Mahati</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Beautiful film, beautiful! I remember sitting in the theatre afterwards not wanting to leave, wanting to experience it again. <br />
    I was a tad confused with the timeline until it hit me, but from then was entranced by where the story and the characters took me. Kaufman’s genius script is so well directed by Gondry, and performed so well by all the players it is truly, my favourite film.
    <br />
    Kate Winslet is beautiful, loveable, infuriating and SO attractive as Clem that Jim Carrey’s Joel has no choice but to fall in love with her again and again. Some of the shots are so wonderful - the shot of them on the frozen Charles River, and one of the two of them on a sofa with this beatific light on Ms. Winslet takes your breath away. <br />
    I love, love, love this film! A masterpiece and one of Jim Carrey’s best performances. Worthy winner of original screenplay Oscar, and disappointed that Carrey wasn’t recognised for his work on it. Enjoy the ride!

<h3>Meri Pyaari Bindu</h3>
<p>It's a story about how a girl and a guy can just be friends too. <br />
   They are both in love with each other but they don't know what it is that makes them so special. They just finally accept that not everyone has a two sided love story. One can love more than the other too.<br />
   What I love the most about this story is that it's not that quintessential boy next door love story. They have shown a pure relationship between a boy and a girl.
